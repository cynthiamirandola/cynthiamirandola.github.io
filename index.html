          <p> I am a motivated and driven young professional who is passionate about continuous
            learning and growth. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics at the University
            of Waterloo and a Bachelor of Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University through
            the Honours Double Degree Program. Additionally, I am working towards a minor in computing at
            UWaterloo and a specialization in accounting at Laurier. </p>
            <p> During my free time, I enjoy playing with my cat, spending quality time with my loved ones,
              immersing myself in a good book, attempting to learn Italian, and keeping myself active by using my exercise bike.</p>
